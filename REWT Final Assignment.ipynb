      "She murmured “Thank you,” in a low voice, and bowed slightly. He dipped his head in acknowledgment. What she wanted to say was too big for saying. The two words she’d managed to get out were its context.\n",
      "But to marry it to a singular interpretation turns the art into a mere instrumental force.\n",
      "One day at the university where he teaches, he and his colleagues arrived to discover that all the waste bins had been removed with no notice. Everyone was told they’d have to make “alternative arrangements” for their garbage. The reasoning for the abrupt banishing of bins was that waste was seen as a sign of inefficiency. Ideally, all inputs should be turned into outputs, data and knowledge into published work, all wihtout a shred of waste! What the bean counters hadn’t understood, the anthropologist went on, is how inefficiency is the very essence of creative practice. Whether one is a blacksmith or a poet, one is bound to produce enormous quantities of waste to make a thing. Wasting time honly has a negative connotation when we accept the narow idea that time is money: wasted time is wasted money and therefore must be inefficient.\n",
      "“But I have to work to make money,” he shot back, full of heat. A worried look came over his face. “If I don’t work, I won’t know my name.”\n",
      "The skin-cracking cold of February. The hot radiator breath of February. The unincorporated area of February, miles inland from March’s coast.\n",
      "“A building’s architecture mimes its explosion.”\n",
      "Before we met, I had spent a lifetime devoted to Wittgenstein’s idea that the inexpressible is contained—inexpressibly!---in the expressed. This idea gets less air time than his more reverential Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent, but it is, I think, the deeper idea. Its paradox is, quite literally, why I write, or how I feel able to keep writing.\n",
      "Lo what I would say, were words good enough. Words are good enough.\n",
      "But I changed too. I looked anew at unnameable things, or at least things whose essence is flicker, flow.\n",
      "It had been a useful solitude, constructed, as it was, around a recent sobriety, long walks to and from the Y through the sordid, bougainvillea-strewn back streets of Hollywood, evening drives up and down Mulholland to kill the long nights, and, or fouce, maniacal bouts of writing, learning to address no one.\n",
      "This could be what a conversation is—simply the outline of a becoming. Gilles Deleuze/Claire Parnet\n",
      "Words change depending on who speaks them there is no cure. The answer isn’t just to introduce new words (boi, cis-gendered, andro-fag), and then set out to reify their meanings (though obviously there is power and pragmatism there). One must also become alert to the multitude of possible uses, possible contexts, the wings with which each word can fly.\n",
      "Here, as elsewhere, contamination makes deep rather than disqualifies.\n",
      "But we do owe ourselves “an intellectual recognition of the fact that at first we were (psychologically) absolutely dependent, and that absolutely means absolutely. Luckily we were met by ordinary devotion.”\n",
      "I realized that age doesn’t necessarily bring anything with it, save itself. The rest is optional.\n",
      "I mean writing that dramatizes the ways in which we are for another or by virtue of another, not in a single instance, but from the start and always.\n",
      "I need the occasional jailbreak, my hypomaniac dot riding the sky.\n",
      "She spent a lot of time talking and writing about that which is more than one, and more than two, but less than infinity. This finitude is important. It makes possible the great mantra, the great invitation of Sedgwick’s work, which is to “pluralize and specify.” (Barthes: “one must pluralize, refine, continuously.”) This is an activity that demands an attentivenesss—a relentlessness, even—whose very rigor tips it into ardor.\n",
      "The key is in the window, the key is in the sunlight at the window . . . the key is in the bars, in the sunlight in the window. Naomi Ginsberg, to Allen\n",
      "That’s what we both hate about fiction, or at least crappy fiction—it purports to provide occasions for thinking through complex issues, but really it has predetermined the positions, stuffed a narrative full of false choices, and hooked you on them, rendering you less able to see out, get out.\n",
      "We ought to say a felling of and, a feeling of if, a feeling of but, and a feeling of by, quite as readily as we say a feeling of blue or a feeling of cold. -Williams James\n",
      "In high spirits, the group entered a grove of pines. Little of the moonlight filtered through the dense pine needles, and in the deepest part of the grove the path seemed to vanish completely. But they all knew the way well.\n",
      "The reflection of the full moon, floating on the surface of the water, was pulled at times into an oval shape by the spreading ripples.\n",
      "How unjust it was, when people treated the actual as limiting proof of the possible! I felt that this was what I was fighting against, and always had been: the tyranny of the particular, arbitrary ways that things happened to have turned out.\n",
      "In any real-life situation, I would pretend I was in a novel, and then do whatever I would want the person in the novel to do. Afterward, I would write it all down, and I would have written a novel, without having had to invent a bunch of fake characters and pretend to care about them.\n",
      "But my parents were the only ones I knew who never acted like I owed them money for being alive, or talked about kids being “spoiled” or “selfish,” or said that I had to be a doctor, or took other adults’ side over mine. I was so grateful that sometimes I sat in my room and cried.\n",
      "Jordan was even taller than I was, she made her own clothes (mostly out of other, pre-existing clothes), and had a tattoo of half a snail, because it had gotten interrupted.\n",
      "The taxi driver already knew how to get to the bus station. Once you got there, it was basically people’s job to asnwer your questions about bus schedules. You didn’t have to explain anything, or account for anything, or manifest love. If anyone got annoyed at you, they couldn’t cry, or scream at you, or accuse you of offending them, and at any point you could leave. It was totally different from being in your family.\n",
      "We were learning past participles. Grammatically, the emphasis was less on doig the thing than on having done it.\n",
      "I decided to try to take a creative writing class—less because I thought I would learn anything, than as a way to convert homework time into writing time.\n"
